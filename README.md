```

## 📖 How to Use

### 1. Getting Started
1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/home.html`
2. Click "🚀 Try the App" to access the main application
3. The app will load with the AI chatbot ready to assist

### 2. Chat with AI Assistant
1. Type your furniture queries in the chat input
2. Examples:
   - "I need a sofa for my living room"
   - "Show me furniture under $1000"
   - "What style goes with modern decor?"
3. The AI will provide recommendations and show available inventory

### 3. Upload Room Photo
1. When prompted, upload a photo of your room
2. The image will be displayed with drawing tools
3. Use the rectangle tool to draw a mask around furniture you want to replace

### 4. Segment and Replace Furniture
1. Click "Confirm" to segment the masked area
2. Review the segmented result
3. Select furniture from recommendations
4. Click "Yes" to apply the furniture to your room
5. Adjust opacity and size using the controls

### 5. View in AR
1. After furniture placement, click "📱 Generate QR Code for Mobile AR"
2. Scan the QR code with your mobile device
3. View the 3D furniture model in AR
4. Place and interact with the furniture in your real space

### 6. Adjust Furniture
- **Opacity**: Use the slider to adjust transparency
- **Size**: Use "🔍 Enlarge" and "🔍 Shrink" buttons
- **Position**: Furniture is automatically placed based on your mask

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints
- `POST /upload` - Upload room image
- `POST /segment/` - Segment objects in image
- `POST /inpainting-image` - Apply furniture replacement
- `POST /chat` - AI chatbot interaction
- `GET /furniture/{filename}` - Serve 3D furniture models
- `GET /thumbnails/{filename}` - Serve furniture thumbnails

### Example API Usage
```javascript
// Upload image
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('image', imageFile);
const response = await fetch('/upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
});

// Chat with AI
const chatResponse = await fetch('/chat', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'I need a sofa' })
});
```

## 🔧 Development Notes

### Key Algorithms
1. **Image Segmentation**: Uses SAM model for precise object detection
2. **Inpainting**: Combines OpenCV algorithms with custom blending
3. **Furniture Placement**: Alpha blending with mask-based positioning
4. **AR Integration**: QR code generation with platform-specific URLs

## 🧪 Testing

All test cases and manual QA scripts live in the `test-cases/` folder at the repository root. It includes:

- `test-cases/SMOKE.md` – quick smoke flows (upload → mask → confirm → replace → AR).
- `test-cases/CHATBOT.md` – inventory-aware chatbot scenarios (e.g., disallow non‑sofa categories).
- `test-cases/RECOMMENDER.md` – cosine similarity ranking checks and fallback behavior.
- `test-cases/FRONTEND.md` – UI checks (segmented/inpainted images not cropped, score rendering, cycling alternatives).

How to execute
- Follow the steps in each markdown file; most tests are manual acceptance checks suitable for demos.
- Where API calls are shown, you can use curl or Postman.

### Performance Considerations
- Images are processed server-side for better performance
- 3D models are optimized for web delivery
- Caching implemented for frequently accessed resources
- Responsive design for mobile compatibility

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support including AR features
- **Firefox**: Full support, limited AR features
- **Safari**: Full support, AR via Scene Viewer
- **Mobile**: Android AR support
